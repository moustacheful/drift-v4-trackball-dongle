# Drift Keyboard V4 — Trackball Edition  
by **Timception**

Welcome to the **Drift Keyboard V4 — Trackball Edition**.  
This version keeps the familiar shape of previous Drift models while introducing some interesting additional features:

---

## 🆕 Key Features

- Includes a **dongle** for improved wireless functionality  
- Adds a **newly integrated trackball** for smoother control  
- Can install sockets for **choc v1/v2 switches**

---

## 🔢 Key Count & Layout

- **63 keys** total  
- Only **5 keys fewer** than Drift V2/V3 (Originally 68 keys)  
- Removed the **outermost columns**, but the layout still provides everything needed to easily migrate from conventioal 60%-65% keyboards  
- The **encoder** is now placed on the **thumb cluster**  
- The **right half** features a **swappable trackball**, allowing you to try different materials or textures

If you’ve used the Drift V2 or V3 before, you’ll adapt to this version very quickly.  
The trackball has been smoothly integrated and is not hard to get used to.

## 🛠️ Design Notes

This model took extensive time and refinement to bring together, and I can easily call it my Masterpiece

- The **OLEDs were removed** to avoid signal interference with the MCU underneath  
- **4-pin OLED sockets remain**, so users can reinstall displays if desired  
- Designed with **maximum modding potential** in mind

## ⚙️ Build Options

The V4 supports multiple build configurations:

- **MX switches** (default)  
- **Choc V1/V2 low-profile** builds  
- Many possibilities for **multiple case designs**, I made many parts for this, and hope to keep making more!

More details will be released soon..
