by **Timception**

Welcome to the **Drift Keyboard V4 — Trackball Edition**.  
This version keeps the familiar shape of previous Drift models while introducing some interesting additional features:

## 🆕 Key Features

- ZMK Studio enabled, and can also be keymapped using [Nick Coutsos' Editor](https://github.com/nickcoutsos/keymap-editor)  
- Connects through a **dongle** for improved wireless functionality  
- Adds a **newly integrated trackball** for smoother control  
- Can install sockets for **choc v1/v2 switches**

---

## 🔢 Key Count & Layout

- **63 keys** total  
- Only **5 keys fewer** than Drift V2/V3 (Originally 68 keys)  
- Removed the **outermost columns**, but the layout still provides everything needed to easily migrate from conventioal 60%-65% keyboards.  
- The **encoder** is now placed on the **thumb cluster**  
- The **right half** features a **swappable trackball**, allowing you to try different materials or textures.

If you’ve used the Drift V2 or V3 before, you’ll adapt to this version very quickly.  
The trackball has been smoothly integrated and is not hard to get used to.

## 🛠️ Design Notes

This model took extensive time and refinement to bring together, and I can easily call it my Masterpiece.

- The **OLEDs were removed** to avoid signal interference with the MCU underneath  
- **4-pin OLED sockets remain**, so users can reinstall displays if desired  
- Designed with **maximum modding potential** in mind

## ⚙️ Build Options

The V4 supports multiple build configurations:

- **MX switch** builds  
- **Choc V1/V2 low-profile** builds  
- Many possibilities for **multiple case designs**, I made many parts for this, and hope to keep making more!

## 🧭 Trackball Behavior & Controls

### ✅ How the Trackball Behaves

#### 🛑 While You're Typing
- The **trackball is disabled while you type**.
- It automatically re-enables **0.5 seconds after the keyboard stops receiving key presses**.

#### 🖱️ While You’re Using the Trackball
- When you move the trackball, the **right half switches to mouse-only mode**.
- This means you **can’t type** on the right side until:
  - You stop moving the trackball for **~1.2 seconds**, **then** the keyboard returns to normal typing mode.
- This prevents accidental mouse activation while typing.

---

### 🔒 Permanent Mouse Mode (Optional)
If you want the right half to stay in mouse mode:

- **Hold `Raise` + press `6`**  
  → Mouse mode stays locked on.
- To exit, **Hold `Raise` + press `6` again**  
  → Returns to normal keyboard operation.

---

### 🎯 Mouse Controls (When Mouse Mode Is Active)

| Action | Key |
|--------|------|
| **Left Click** | `K` |
| **Right Click** | `L` |
| **Scroll** | Hold `O` + move the trackball |

---

### 🎥 Extra 3D Navigation Functions (Optional)
For users working in **3D programs**, Drift V4 includes two special macros:

#### 🌀 Orbit
- **Key:** `.` (period)
- **Function:** Holds **Shift + Middle Click** while the trackball moves  
- **Usage:** Rotate/orbit around models and objects

#### 📐 Pan
- **Key:** `,` (comma)
- **Function:** Holds **Middle Click** while the trackball moves  
- **Usage:** Pan the view horizontally/vertically in 3D space  

---

### ⚙️ Customizing Trackball Behavior
If you want to customize how the trackball or mouse keys work, you’ll need to update your firmware:

- Edit your fork on GitHub  
- Recompile the firmware  
- Flash **all three devices**: left half, right half, and dongle

This keyboard was conceptualized and developed in parallel with Drift Keyboard V3, but just have not been released at the same time.  
The designs for this version are original and thought of by me, not based on any existing keyboard other than the original Drift Keyboard.
